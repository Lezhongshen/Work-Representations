### In collaboration with IPSOS and Danish Crown, I conducted a research project on consumer segmentation of meat and meat-alternatives, utilizing the demand space market segmentation method and topic modeling. Using large scale questionnaire data from 6 countries, dimensionality reduction was firstly employed, including using the Principle Components Analysis (PCA) to extract features and random forest to select key features. Subsequently, by using the K-prototypes model to cluster the data, 6 clusters are discovered. The segments were further refined by utilizing an index method from IPSOS.Then, Python was employed to extract twitter data pertaining to meat, and after preprocessing, topic modeling was applied to the data in order to validate the pattern and provide deeper insights by comparing with the clustering results. Finally, a cross-tabulation analysis was carried out to study the distribution of various products within different demand spaces and countries. This project is graded with 12/A.
