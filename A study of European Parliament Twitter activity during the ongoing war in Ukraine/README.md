### Our study examined the expression of sanctions towards Russia on Twitter by members of the European Parliament following the invasion of Ukraine, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. We used netnographic fieldwork to understand the phenomenon on Twitter, then developed preliminary keywords, and used content analysis and text analytics to develop and analyze them. We also used visual network analysis to study retweet patterns, and applied topic modeling and sentiment analysis to explore the conversations about sanctions.
